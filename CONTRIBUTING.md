## How to Contribute
### Reporting Issues
If you encounter bugs, issues, or have suggestions for improvement, please follow these steps:

1. Check the existing issues to see if the problem or suggestion has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description.
    - Include steps to reproduce the issue if applicable.
    - Provide information about your environment (e.g., operating system, browser, or programming language version).

### Proposing Changes
We welcome contributions! If you'd like to propose changes or additions to the project:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push the changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request on the main repository.

### Code Style Guidelines
To maintain consistency and readability, follow these code style guidelines:

- 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names. 
- Use whitespace to make code more readable.
- No trailing whitespace at the end of a line.
- Only use comments to explain the algorithm.
- Space between `if` and `(` (if (param) ...).
- `f(void)` for 0-argument function declarations.
- Newline between `}` and `else` instead of `} else {...}`.

### Commit Messages
Please follow the conventional commit message format for our commits:

- **Type**: Start with a type, such as:
    - `fix`:  A bug fix.
    - `docs`: Documentation changes.
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.).
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **Imperative Mood**: Write the commit message in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- **Concise and Descriptive**: Keep it clear and concise, providing relevant details without unnecessary information.
- **Reference Issues**: If your commit relates to a specific issue, include a reference to that issue in the commit message. For example, "Fix #123: Resolve bug with problemName.cpp."

Example commit message 1:
```
fix: Fix calculation bug in "Diamond Shape.cpp"

Use double instead of float for more precision.

Closes #5
```

Example commit message 2:
```
refactor: Simplify "Diamond Shape.cpp" algorithm for improved readability

Replace repetitive code with a reusable function.
```

### Submitting a Pull Request
When submitting a pull request:

1. Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
2. Reference any related issues in your pull request.
3. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main repository.

### Issues and Labels
